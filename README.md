# Dataset_Creation_for_Video_Classification
Decompose video into mini video when there is a scene change.

The following repository allows the creation of datasets from multiple video files. Using a shot boundary detection technique with background subtraction/detection, it is possible to decompose a video into mini-videos when there is a scene change, enabling the creation of multiple video files for the training of the neural networks.
